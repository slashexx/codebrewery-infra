## Overview

CodeBrewery Infra provides all the scripts and manifests to define and manage the infrastructure for CodeBrewery. The repository leverages **Terraform** for cloud resource provisioning and **Kubernetes** for application orchestration. 

It follows a **GitOps** model, ensuring infrastructure is declaratively managed, version-controlled, and easily reproducible.
